## Performance Rating Scale (3-Point Scale)

**Note:** TWM uses a 3-point performance rating scale.

### Exceeded

The employee’s performance far exceeded expectations due to exceptionally high-quality work performed in all essential areas of responsibility. The overall quality of work was superior and included the completion of a major goal or project, or an exceptional or unique contribution in support of unit, department, or organizational objectives. This rating is achievable by any employee, though given infrequently.

### Achieved

The employee’s performance consistently met expectations in all essential areas of responsibility and, at times, exceeded expectations. The quality of work overall was very good. The most critical annual goals were met. The employee typically demonstrates proficient knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the role.

### Not Achieved

The employee’s performance did not consistently meet expectations and failed to meet expectations in one or more essential areas of responsibility. One or more critical goals were not met. The employee’s work generally falls short of performance goals and provides minimal support to organizational contributions.
